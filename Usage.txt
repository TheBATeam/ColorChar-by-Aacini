Show characters in color from Ascii codes and string literals.

   ColorChar  /bf  { code[*times] | "literal" } ...

<bf> specify a BackFore-ground color attribute (see COLOR /? for more info).

<times> repeat the previous Ascii <code> character that number of times;
a "X" letter may be used instead of the asterisk.

This is a stripped down version of ColorShow.exe with no variable support.
